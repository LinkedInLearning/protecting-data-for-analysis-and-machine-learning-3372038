Data Security: Defending against people accessing the data when they shouldn't have access.

Data Privacy: The proper handling of data, most importantly sensitive data, throughout the data lifecycle.

Preprocessing: The process of converting raw datasets into a format that is consumable, understandable, and usable for further analysis.

Data Anonymization: The process of removing or modifying sensitive or personal information from a data set.

Masking: Data Masking is the process of modifying sensitive data to create fake but realistic versions of data.  It's great to use on phone numbers, credit card numbers, and social security numbers!

Encryption: Encryption uses a hash function which passes data through a formula that produces a string of characters as a result.  This is great to use on bank account numbers, ATM PINs, and emails!

Generalization: Generalization is the deliberate removal of some of the data in order to make it less identifiable.  This works well with gender, race, and dates of birth!

Perturbation: Perturbation applys round-numbering methods and adds random noise.  It's great on data like employment duration, credit scores, and salary!

Pseudonymization: Pseudonymization replaces data with pseudonyms, or placeholder values.  Employee IDs, location data, and names are great to use for this technique!
