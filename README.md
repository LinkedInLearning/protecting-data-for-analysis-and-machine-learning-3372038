# Protecting Data for Analysis and Machine Learning
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Protecting Data for Analysis and Machine Learning`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has several files you can use to protect your data!

## Practice_Course-Notebook.ipynb
This file is what you will use to follow along with the course code and write it yourself. You can add code and run it right in the Codespace. You may have to install extensions if prompted. If so, select the Python Kernel when asked which kernel to use above.

## Completed_Course-Notebook.ipynb
This is the same as the Practice_Course-Notebook file, but with the code already filled out. You can run the code directly from this notebook if you'd prefer to have the code in its final state.

## Glossary.md
This is a helpful list of data security terms you can reference once the course is complete.

## Professsional Organizations.md
This has some professional organizations you can join if you want to stay current in data security.
